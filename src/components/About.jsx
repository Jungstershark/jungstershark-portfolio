        As a SEA Games ðŸ¥‡ Gold Medalist turned technologist, I've built my career at the intersection of discipline, engineering, and strategy. With over $4M in value delivered across Shopee, Agoda, and Deloitte, I bring a rare blend of execution and leadership â€” from scaling AI infra to reshaping user workflows for 100K+ daily users.

        Beyond engineering, I care deeply about human potential. Iâ€™ve led student government, national initiatives, and my universityâ€™s swim team to historic success â€” all while balancing elite sport with academic excellence. My mission is to build a more equitable, efficient Southeast Asia through technology and consulting.
